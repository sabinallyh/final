                    <p>This project was done together with the Assa Abloy Global UX Team, and the problem definition was “ to identify changed customer behaviours, as a result of the significant switch to online purchasing, and to thereby target new customer needs and how to accommodate them”. We pitched various solutions to this problem and will go about presenting them one by one. Our MVP was to engage users on the facebook site, as we noticed it had client activity but none from the brand itself. This would be the easiest way to meet the customers in their issues and problems.<br></p>

                <p>One idea we decided to prototype was a quiz that we’d like to call “Find your smart lock”. This idea came to us while looking at how competitive companies work, and this specific design was inspired by Glue’s website.</p>
                <p>By asking the customer to select the picture that looks the most like the lock they have today, we could simplify the research process, and possibly present the customer with the best smart lock option for them. </p>       
                <p>Step 1: The customer selects their locktype, i.e. the lock that looks the most like the one they have today</p>      
                <p>Step 2: The customer is presented with a description of the lock they selected, as well as more images of what their lock might look like today. To move on, the customer has to confirm with either “This is my locktype” or “This is not my locktype”. The second option brings them back to the previous step.</p>
